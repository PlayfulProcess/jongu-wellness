### How to Use This

- **Open Access:** All tools are completely free, supported by community donations
- **Human-centered:** Most tools remain valuable without AI engagement. Recommended by real people, not algorithms. The more people save a resource, the higher it appears
- **Community-Driven:** [Learn how to create a tool](https://www.recursive.eco/pages/courses/course-viewer.html?course=vibe-coding-101) and submit below!
- **Customizable:** Save tools for easy access later in your dashboard. Customize tools hosted in Claude. Create your own journaling prompts in [our journaling tool](https://journal.recursive.eco/) and save your work (only you can access it later)
