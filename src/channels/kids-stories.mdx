<Text>
Welcome to our shared library of children’s stories. Here, parents can contribute safe, educational playlists designed to offer calm, focused viewing experiences for kids.

All submissions are reviewed before appearing on this channel.

Our new **[COPPA-compliant viewing tool](https://kids.recursive.eco)** does not collect personal data and can be locked so children can navigate only within this channel’s content—a kiosk-style, distraction-free experience.
